I also like arch's dedication to simplicity and think they're the best pure rolling release around, and I feel like Debian testing strikes a good balance between stability and bleeding edge software which is why I use it as my primary OS. As for Fedora, I've only just installed it, along with FreeBSD, on an old desktop I recently inherited and while my initial impression of both is favorable I haven't played with either of them enough to form much of an opinion yet. As for Raspbian, it seemed like the best option to make my raspberry pi do what I wanted. run Kodi, a Bittorrent client, and run a traditional desktop environment/window manager so I can use my TV like a giant desktop when I feel like it, and it's performed all three functions admirably.","GNOME 3, i3, KDE, LXDE, XFCE","I've been using GNOME for about half a decade now and at this point it seems like second nature, and even though it got some hate I've always felt like GNOME 3 was actually a pretty substantial imporvement over GNOME 2 which was starting to show it's age at the time. I installed i3 because I wanted to try a tiling window manager and I fell in love with it pretty quickly, it just feels so much more efficient, it may well wind up replacing GNOME 3 as my primary DE/WM. LXDE was the default desktop environment when I isntalled Raspbian and I just didn't see much reason to bother replacing it since it's a fine desktop environment and I just leave my Raspberry pi running Kodi most of the time anyway. I only recently installed KDE and XFCE on a new computer and haven't played with either of them much yet. I installed KDE because I heard KDE 5 was a massive improvment over KDE 4 and I wanted to check it out for myself and I installed XFCE with the intention of replacing xfwm with bspwm to create a kind of hybrid tiling XFCE inspired by a post I saw here on unixporn, I just haven't gotten around to that part yet.","Adwaita, Numix","GNOME, Numix",No,Archey,"Chromium, Firefox, w3m","Chromium is my browser of choice, I prefer it over Chrome because I'd rather use the one that's entirely open source and I never really use the extra features in Chrome. I also keep Firefox installed as an alternative to Chromium in case I feel like a change of pace, although generally I feel like Chromium/Chrome is just the better browser of the two these days. I keep w3m installed because once in a blue moon I'll get smashed and feel like pretending I'm a 1337 hax0r and obviously a text-based browser is the only acceptable option in such a situation.",Emacs,"I tried to use Vim once, it was a nightmare, I couldn't even figure out how to exit Vim. Emacs, on the other hand, always struck me as more intuitive, and since I switched to using Emacs full time a couple of years ago it's just continued to feel more and more natural as time goes by. In any case, I'd only seriously consider using a text editor that can be used from the terminal since I use ssh a lot and Emacs and Vim are the only widespread, feature rich options I know of that meet that criteria.",,Yes,FreeBSD,I'm new to BSD and as far as I know FreeBSD is by far the most popular of the *BSD's so it seemed like a natural place to start.,XFCE,To try something different from what I usually use.,No,No,No,No,"Chromium, Firefox",Same reason I picked them for Linux.,Emacs,Because I like it more than Vim.,I've only installed FreeBSD for the first time earlier this week and haven't had much time to play with it yet.

Fifteen years ago, customizing Unix desktops used to be an incredibly diverse worl. It was certainly a ""pimp my ride"" sort of thing, but it had roots in the computer art scene and it made for a very efervescent, anti-compliant climate.

Nowadays, the trend is reversed, primarily because computer design is increasingly about compliance, quick delivery and low price, not about ergonomics and value. This isn't bad, it's a natural (and, IMHO, welcome) result of the fact that technology became more pervasive and needed to become more predictable. It's one of the things that opens computing to the masses, and that's a good thing no matter how you put it. 

But it should not lead to a demise of originality, and I think original creations should be more prominent.

What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!

For example, if Arc is banned for a fortnight, announce it in a stickied post and let people post their Arc screenshots in that thread. That way the rest of us don't have to see them. It should minimise backlash but it would still be a lot of work for the moderators to enforce. It would also segregate the community a bit, but it's not as drastic as having a separate subreddit -- which we all know doesn't work -- and it's only temporary, it doesn't kick out the Numix fans forever. The main issue is in choosing what to ban, and for how long.
It's clear that subscribers here don't like seeing what they can see everywhere else. In previous surveys I've asked for more variety, but I don't think that's right any more. The type of people who are conventionally attracted to this subreddit are looking for their fix -- for content that appeals to the hacker aesthetic -- and to share content of their own that would be similarly appreciated. I'm young and from a generation that's about as far as you can get from the fabled *nix hackers of old, but I'm fascinated by the way that era has shaped our senses of elegance and usability. Whether rightly or not, I lurk this sub to see things that are inspired by, or outright emulate, the way things used to be in desktop computing. There are plenty of opportunities elsewhere to see ""modern"" UI designs, especially since most of us are surrounded by them these days, so I think it's worth saving a place for the old way of doing things.
Personally, I'd be happy for the mods to decide what gets a ban, because you guys know the community better than anyone. I know you listen to us because you put out regular surveys like this one :)
