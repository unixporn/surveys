3. Image 14 of 55 in the 2017 survey says, ""why that distro?"" after the both the distro and the DE/WM questions. Of course, the second questions should instead be, ""why that DE/WM?""
4. Add a question for emoji/symbol fonts.
5. Brand(s) of device(s) (include option for custom).
6. ""Why Windows?"" could be broken down by checkboxes instead of free-response. It'd be cool to see a bar graph instead of just a numerical ranking.
