# Survey Data
This repository holds all the files to do with surveys the subreddit has run. This includes raw CSV/ODS data files, copies of SVG graphics for summary posts, and PDF copies of the original surveys. Summary graphics are licensed under the GPL v3+; everything else is not.

Most all of this data was collected and put here for storing pre-GDPR. If you have an issue with some of your identifiable personal data which is stored in this repository, [please contact the moderator team](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/unixporn).
